In the last installment of this series, “[Why Asynchronous Video is Awesome for Business Communications Part 1](http://carpoolagency.com/articles/Why-Asynchronous-Video-is-Awesome-for-Business-Communications-Part-1.html),” Jarom Reid and Alexandra Kruse shared some of their thoughts about asynchronous video.

At Carpool, we use video all the time, but not always in the way you might think. Beyond Skype and Facebook video chat, we have deployed a range of video communication channels to help us move information more efficiently and engage more deeply with content.

With recorded video shared to [Yammer](http://carpoolagency.com/articles/2016%E2%80%9309%E2%80%9328-How-to-Use-Yammer-for-Internal-Collaboration.html) and now Facebook at Work [live video](https://work.fb.com/), we’re able to quickly share client updates internally without having to gather everyone at the same time for a debrief or update. By asynchronous, we mean all types of video usages that don’t require two or more people communicating at the same time. Whereas we used to set up in-person meetings—which requires downtime while we wait for everyone’s schedules to line up—now we tend to record a video and let Carpool employees get the information when they have the bandwidth to do so.

“I like that it allows for the engagement to happen quickly and those who need to know and take action aren’t waiting for everyone to be in the same place at the same time,” Jarom explained in Part 1.

This week, we’re staying on the same topic, but turning to Account Director/Business Development Darren Litchfield and Director of Strategy Chris Slemp for their thoughts on using video. For Darren, this is especially important as he is a [remote employee](http://carpoolagency.com/articles/Carpool-Asks-Employees-to-Work-Remotely-for-One-Month.html) located in Atlanta, a long ways away from Carpool’s headquarters in Bellevue.

Video, in general, adds another element to text and images. Meetings are enhanced as attendees can get much more context through body language. The next step is to make video conferences as convenient as a written message. A written message can be consumed when the recipient has time. This means communication can happen more quickly since you don’t have to wait for everyone to be available at the same time.

However, as this becomes more commonplace, some unwritten rules need to be established. People tend to get nervous when a camera is on, which can cause messages to be less polished and concise. In a written message, you only consume what the author refined into a (hopefully) concise message. Think about how often you re-read and re-type even little parts of business communications to make sure the messaging is right. This also speaks to organization. People tend to be more organized in their written communication than their video posts. If people give the same organizational effort in quick video posts that they do in written posts, there are many situations that can benefit greatly from video context.

Darren hits some important points about our relative lack of comfort with video, especially if we’re not going to the effort to script something out and edit it. We’re still the TV/movie generation, and have grown up equating video with polish. However, the upcoming Selfie generation is much more comfortable in front of a camera. What is Snapchat if not [visual texting](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/magazine/how-i-learned-to-love-snapchat.html?_r=0) with myself as the subject? As we all get over our nerves and [embrace authenticity](http://carpoolagency.com/articles/Professional-and-Personal-Behavior-Creating-Your-Personal-Brand.html), casual video updates will become more natural.

There’s an undeniable advantage to video: We’re wired to be attracted to, and to learn more from, a personal delivery than the written word. If a picture is worth 1,000 words, a video delivery speaks volumes. The challenge that remains is the lack of easy skimming or retrieval of the content. However, once text-to-speech is fully integrated and made available for search—or as insta-transcripts—that hurdle will be a thing of the past.

The role of video in internal communications is and will continue to be pivotal. We see the evidence as our clients embrace it even faster than new social platforms. In fact, we’re curious to see if the increased integration of video with social, as we now see in [Facebook Live at Work](https://work.fb.com/), will accelerate the adoption of those networks.
