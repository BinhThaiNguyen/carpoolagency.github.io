Enterprise social, as a term, suffers from buzzword syndrome. These internal communications networks have proliferated across so many organizations, that it can be easy to lose sight of what actually makes them useful for day-to-day business.

Here, you will find a few stats, facts, and observations about social communications strategies that should further illuminate the value of opening up your network to the power of your employees' collective IQ.
  
 1. Productivity Nitro Fuel
 
 According to McKinsey Global Institute, organizations with connected employees see an average productivity increase of 20 to 25 percent.
  
 2. Waste Elimination
 
 The average employee spends nearly half their time managing email (28 percent) and hunting for information to do their job (14 percent), leaving little time to collaborate (19 percent) and perform tasks (39 percent).
  
 3. It's Popular
 
 In a survey of companies with more than 250 employees, 79 percent reported they used or had plans to launch an enterprise social network. Of course, many companies that implement a network do so without an effective engagement strategy.
  
 4. Geek Gods
 
 MIT uses Yammer to manage communications, and they seem pretty smart.
  
 5. Inbox Relief
 
 Companies that use Yammer—along with the proper social strategies applied through the right tools—see reductions in email of about 40 percent.
  
 6. Growth Industry
 
 By 2016, according to Gartner, half of large organizations will use an internal social network, and about one-third of them will find that it's as essential to their business as email or telephones.
  
 7. Crowd Sourcing is Big Business
 
 When IBM turned to crowd sourcing, the internal crowd identified 10 incubator businesses that went on to receive $100 million in funding.
 
 8. People Are Inherently Social
 
 When the accounting firm Grant Thornton surveyed employees about the company's recently implemented internal social network, 67 percent reported feeling better connected to the business, 54 percent said they had benefited from asking questions and sharing answers socially, and 76 percent said they would recommend colleagues join the network as well.
  
 9. Employees Want it Bad Enough to Pay
 
 In an international Microsoft survey of 9,000 employees, roughly one-third said they would even be willing to pay for a social tool if it made them more efficient at work.
  
 10. Rising in Popularity
 
 In a global survey about enterprise social and collaboration, 82 percent of businesses that were already using social tools said they wanted to use more of them in the future.
