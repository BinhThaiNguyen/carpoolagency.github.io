Writing is a lot like singing: Anyone can do it, fewer people devote the time to do it well, and even fewer seek out an audience to potentially criticize what they do.

For nearly a decade, I have been putting pen to paper (metaphorically speaking, because paper is totally lame, from what I’ve been told) and getting paid to do so. When I began writing and telling stories for a living, there were no iPhones, hashtags were better known as pound keys, and several people in this office were still in the throes of puberty. Now I’m older and grayer, with a hairline that looks like Eddie Munster with a drinking problem, and approximately 1 million published words under my belt. But still to this day I cringe when I go back and read my old work.

For me, re-reading old articles is a form of masochistic catharsis; like picking at an old scab and refusing to let it heal. It’s both the realization that I’m only as good as the last thing I wrote, but the hope that the things I write in the future will be made better by past mistakes. And despite this rambling introduction, I swear there’s a point on the way.

As Ernest Hemmingway once said, "The first draft of anything is sh*t." (The asterisk is mine.)

Deadlines are the scourge of the writer. Nothing is ever good, it’s just as good as it’s going to be before it’s published. This is why we have rough drafts. Approximately 98 percent of my energy is devoted to the Sisyphean task of making each draft suck just a little bit less than the one before it. The other 2 percent goes toward spell-check.

Writing should be somewhat torturous, because the result of a little existential anguish and self-doubt is often more enjoyable to the reader than something that required little effort and less pain.

Some writers languish over every word in the way a sushi chef delicately slices pieces of tuna. Others take the supermarket butcher approach by hacking away at a bloody carcass (blurting out all the words at once) until it resembles something digestible, then refining it later (laborious editing).

Either method is, of course, perfectly acceptable. However, the common thread that runs through each is revision. And that brings me to my first tip on writing.

##1. Be Meticulous
Once is not enough. A decent piece of written content requires at least two passes, if not three, four, or even five. Your first pass allows you to polish away any glaring typos and revise the work to clarify thoughts and phrasing. On the second pass you can rewrite and refine, then begin eliminating sections that are too clunky, unnecessarily flamboyant, or that fail to make a cogent point.

##2. Be Merciless
I’m going to let you in on a little secret: No one will ever know that you’ve cut something. You can cut a few words or a complete sentence or even several paragraphs. Ultimately, your reader will never be the wiser. Now that you know the secret, be brutal and unforgiving with your words. It takes more effort to salvage a poorly turned phrase or rambling thought than it does to just scrap it entirely. Think of it like needlessly holding on to an old pair of underwear with a hole in the crotch. Sure, you can keep them, but why? And will you really miss them when they’re gone?

##3. Be Confident
One of the most common mistakes I've seen from young journalists and writers, and one that I suffered from in my early days as well, arises from the mistaken belief that the writer has to appease her or his audience. The desire to be inoffensive and widely appealing, though understandable, often comes across as being smarmy. And smarm turns off readers like a pile of dead skunks by the side of the road. When readers come across an obviously feigned sentiment or half-hearted argument, they roll up the windows, hit the gas, and try to drive away as fast as possible.

##4. Be Concise; Be Clear
A well-composed thought is like a special operative. It gets in, does what it needs to do, and gets out quickly. Linger on a thought too long, or belabor a point for the sake of fluffing up your word count or flaunting your vocabulary, and your audience will grow bored and move on. Have you ever read something and found yourself skipping lines? That’s the result of a writer who didn’t know when to cut and run.
