In Web design, a scattered strategy can lead to more hassle on the backend and a mess on the front end, with the design team managing multiple bugs across disconnected (though similar) platforms. 
  
A comparable philosophy can apply to internal communications, where the goal is to get out information quickly, simply, and to the proper place. This, of course, is the goal behind Carpool’s content syndication system.

Driven by strategically created hashtags, content published in one place can be funneled throughout a network and distributed in the way that makes the most sense. Using this system of hashtags, a team can set parameters to automatically populate content on their specific team site so it’s readily available and properly formatted for them. Whether a piece of content ultimately ends up in the form of a rotating article with an image or simply a headline in a sidebar, it gets where it needs to go. 
  
But why do we operate this way? After all, it’s easy enough to put information—updates, letters from the CEO, or perhaps a new contract template—into a regular newsletter and distribute that company-wide. Of course, as with any mass-distributed un-curated piece of content, the important stuff stands the chance of becoming lost among the noise. Much like the non-responsively designed website, the old way of doing things works, but it’s far from perfect and create new problems. 
  
Syndicated content increases the message’s visibility, but diminishes the work required to distribute it. In this regard, syndicated content is a means of redefining internal communications in the same way that responsive design redefined Web design.
 
Back in 2010, Web designer Ethan Marcotte wrote what has been referred to some as the seminal article on responsive design. 
  
“Can we really continue to commit to supporting each new user agent with its own bespoke experience?” Marcotte wrote back in a time when responsive design was still a relatively new concept. “At some point, this starts to feel like a zero sum game.” 
  
Translation: There are so many variations of screen sizes, resolution, and ratios that accommodating everyone is a losing battle. However, it makes much more sense to rethink design so that one format can scale as needed. 
  
A responsively designed site is coded to automatically scale content based on the size of the device on which it’s displayed. Whether the user is browsing from a phone, tablet, or desktop, the site is designed to be attractive and useful across all formats. Behind that design philosophy is the very simple principle of minimizing the work necessary to publish something while maximizing the potential audience. You create something, publish it once, and seamlessly distribute it among a myriad of platforms. 
  
Another way to accomplish the same goal—though not ideal—is to build a website, then build a mobile version, and perhaps throw in a tablet version to boot. Given the daunting and ever-increasing number and varieties of devices, this method works, but it’s messy and inefficient. Think of it like responding to a group email, but rather than clicking reply all you reply to each recipient individually, and just rewrite the content from memory each time. 
 
To communicate effectively, it's necessary to rethink how content is distributed. Much like a responsively designed site, internal comms content must be distributed in a way that is malleable and adaptable in order to have the greatest reach and serve its intended purpose.
