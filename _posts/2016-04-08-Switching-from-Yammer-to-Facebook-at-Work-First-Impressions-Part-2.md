What? You haven't read Part 1? First, go check out what Carpool Director of Strategy Chris Slemp and Strategy Manager Noah Sparks had to say about [making the switch from Yammer to FB@W](http://carpoolagency.com/articles/Switching-from-Yammer-to-Facebook-at-Work-First-Impressions-Part-1.html), then come back here for the conclusion.

There was no transitional period, no prep work. We just did it. One day we were on Yammer, then next day we were on Facebook. There was no pain, only a few tears shed, and generally the Carpool team made the switch with ease. After about a month on the new platform, we’ve had enough time to compare and contrast between Facebook and Yammer, and just marinate on the Facebook vibe. Below, you will find a variety of opinions on the strengths and weaknesses of Facebook at Work from Carpool employees.

Katie: Acct. Manager, new to ESNs, California
---------------------------------------------

Oddly enough, FB@W is the first [Enterprise Social Network](http://carpoolagency.com/articles/5-Arguments-Against-Going-Social-and-How-to-Combat-Them.html) (ESN) I have used on a regular basis. I’ve worked in multiple global communications agencies over the past 20 years and this is the first time I’ve used any kind of social platform to facilitate my workflow and communications. My first impression: Facebook at Work is brilliant. 
 
Using the social network—and one that the majority of the world is already trained on—provides a low barrier to entry and easy adoption. I realize that, as communications professionals, we are much more interested in the art of communication than the average person, but people in our company didn’t need much convincing to adopt FB@W. I look to FB@W as more of a company-culture accelerator, rather than a “task master.” The reduction in email I receive from clients and coworkers is simply the byproduct of a strong company culture. I also see it as a great way to bridge global companies around the world—where local offices and satellite teams can connect to accelerate communications within different cultures—to truly deliver for companies that are going “glocal.”
 
As a remote employee, one of my favorite benefits of FB@W is that I can absorb the culture of my company and the personalities of my coworkers in real-time, despite the fact that I’m located 1,000 miles away from the office. It is an amazing tool to bridge geographies. It also gives a voice to employees who may not be social in the real world, but find their place in online groups and forums. FB@W give us the forum to be bold risk-takers, ask questions, be playful, and find acceptance. I honestly feel it can make companies better and more aware. It is the ultimate mirror of the company culture, and for the senior executives who want to listen, they’d be hard pressed to find a better tool to tap the heart and the pulse of their company. 


Cameron: Account Manager, Bellevue
----------------------------------

I utilized Yammer internally at Carpool for over a year before we made the switch to FB@W. Had we not used Yammer previously, the transition from [email](http://carpoolagency.com/articles/What-Rats-Can-Teach-Us-About-Email.html) to social would undoubtedly have been more difficult and the impact would have likely been more noticeable.  
 
My feedback is focused more heavily on the details and product functionality of FB@W, as I became accustomed to features within Yammer that are not part of FB@W. I feel that I was more efficiently able to complete actual work within Yammer, while FB@W almost tries to not help people accomplish work, but help them create a network to socialize with their coworkers. I enjoyed the productivity features of Yammer, but since we utilize FB@W in nearly the same way, I have been able to find ways to work around the lacking features.

Kylie: Project Manager, Bellevue
--------------------------------
When I started with this company, as someone who was familiar with Facebook, it was fairly easy to adjust to FB@W. It was familiar and fun and interactive. I had never used a social tool internally for work before, but this was an easy transition to make.
 
I like that there are different groups to organize posts and that I can subscribe to groups most relevant to my job, which means I don’t get spammed with irrelevant messages. The call feature also really stood out to me. I have never paid attention to this on my personal FB before, as I had no need for it. But at work there have been times when it provides real value, such as when Skype has not worked and I was able to successfully call a colleague directly from FB@W without a phone number. FB@W eliminates the use for email, which is a huge time-saver. Now, I no longer have to search through my email to find a conversation or worry about accidentally deleting something. Instead, I can go to FB@W and the conversation is in one of the groups or in a message. 
 
One of Carpool’s principles is to [work out loud](http://carpoolagency.com/about/). FB@W really allows us to do just that.

The Winner?
-----------
  
Well, we can’t quite declare a winner or loser. Like other [communications tools](http://carpoolagency.com/articles/Implementation-Strategy.html), FB@W has its strengths and weaknesses. But overall, it’s been a positive transition within Carpool.
