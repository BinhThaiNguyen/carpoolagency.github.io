“See you in a month!”

<!--more-->

That was essentially the message doled out to the employees of Carpool, an internal communications agency in Bellevue, Wash. From July 5 through July 29, the entire Carpool workforce will no longer be coming to the office and will instead work remotely from home, or anywhere else they feel will help them be most productive.

As a company that embodies the principles of working out loud, using collaborative tools to communicate, and modernizing the way people work, this was the next logical step in the evolution of the modern workplace.

During the so-called “Office Anywhere” experiment, Carpool employees will spend little, if any, time in the Carpool offices, located in downtown Bellevue. Though this type of experiment might seem daunting to some, for Carpool it’s more of a sidestep than a pivot when it comes to the way we work. Carpool employees often work from home, using collaborative networks like Facebook at Work and, previously, Yammer, to coordinate projects, pitch ideas, and stay on top of daily workflows. With Facebook at Work, for example, Carpool was able to successfully hire two account leads who are located thousands of miles away from our headquarters. Additionally, a longtime Carpool business lead recently moved cross-country to Atlanta, Ga., without any interruption to his output or ability to communicate with Washington-based team members.
