The Carpool pilot is your opportunity to experience a modern way of working before you fully commit.
<br>
<br>
If you've read through our website or talked to one of our people, you already know that we are fascinated and passionate about the flow of information. We whole-heartedly believe that improving the flow of information throughout your organization will help your employees work faster, make their jobs easier, and help them be more accurate, thus creating greater value throughout your company. A Carpool pilot allows you to preview the potential benefits and create a case study that can be used to help get others onboard for future buildout.  

##It's All About the Numbers
If weâ€™ve learned anything about communications, it's that numbers (data and analytics) tell us stories. Numbers speak to us, and it so happens we are really good at listening. We use the data we capture to improve on what's working, tweak what's not, and discover new opportunities to grow.  
<br><br>
What's Included:   

-  Team sites [LINK TO IMPLEMENT PAGE] are the nucleus of any internal communications strategy because they house the formal information that drives your most valuable assets.
-  Design includes a current state analysis and a future state vision and strategy. Get a deeper understanding of environment design [LINK TO DESIGN PAGE] process here.
-  Implement is where we roll out the strategy and start working with your people. We update, build, and renovate your technology solution, then teach pilot participants how to reimagine the way they work.

<br>
Support means we won't leave this to you and your team to figure out. Our experienced team of professional strategists will help out wherever they are needed: site management, content development, community management, publishing cadence, as well as training and coaching.  

##Schedule
The timing of the pilot will depend on the number of people participating and the technology management required.  

-  Small (1 team): 6 weeks
-  Medium (2-3 teams): 8-10 weeks  
-  Large (5+ teams): 12+ weeks

Requirements
Office 365
Some keen as peeps
Key stakeholders (number will depend on the size of your pilot)
Executive sponsorship
Bright and cheery disposition
