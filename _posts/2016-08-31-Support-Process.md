Thank you for choosing Carpool Agency!

<!--more-->

We want to make sure that your needs are met as quickly as possible, so we’ve instituted a process to log, track, reply to, and address your concerns with haste. All you have to do is send an e-mail to [support@carpoolagency.com](mailto:support@carpoolagency.com).

You’ll get an automated response to confirm that we received your message, followed by an e-mail from a member of our support team within 24 hours on weekdays or by the next workday at noon on holidays or weekends detailing our intended actions and expected delivery time or asking for clarification if needed.

In the case of an emergency, please feel free to reach out to your direct contact at Carpool or give us a call or text at (425) 954-3471.

For changes which could possibly be disruptive, we’ll set up a stage site for our updates and send it to you for approval before pushing live. Once the live site has been updated, we’ll send a notification of completion.

Here at Carpool, we appreciate your time and business, and we look forward to maintaining a relationship of trust.
