# Effective Communication and the Information Flow

Communication is about much more than the tools we use. When we focus on just the tools, we gloss over an essential element of the conversation we should be having.

Rather than dissecting the way we communicate, it’s time to begin discussing the how and why.

Gartner reports that 80% of [effective communication](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2319215 "The Flow of Information") is based on the organization’s culture and the personalities of the people behind it. On the other hand, only 20%can be attributed to the tools used to do the communicating.
