<p>Most people really like their phones.<br/>
Every day, for example, the average millennial checks his or her phone 43 times while contributing and consuming reams of content. </p>

<!--more-->

<p>And 71% of millennials say they <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/238294" target="_blank">engage with social media</a> on a daily basis, which equates to an average of 5.4 hours per day. More so, 49% say they most often engage with media online because it allows them to multitask.
</p>

<p>But despite the amount of time and energy that millennials devote to consuming media — social or otherwise — it’s rare to hear them complain of being bogged down by overfilled inboxes or mounting piles of notifications. Actually, most people volunteer for the onslaught of information. According to <a href="http://info.localytics.com/blog/52-percent-of-users-enable-push-messaging" target="_blank">research by Localytics</a>, more than half of mobile users enable push notifications on their phones.</p>

<p>What statistics like these indicate is that millennials — and logically other demographic groups — are constantly on their phones, regularly engaging with and creating content, navigating multiple apps at once, and actually inviting their apps to interrupt their days with notifications. Before you roll your eyes about this mild glorification of millennials, consider that the reason we focus on them is because they are the early adopters. They don’t understand the old ways of communicating because they were born digital. Although millennials are the poster children for change, most of us are living the same way in our consumer lives. We are living this change as well. It’s just that we’re also holding on to old habits because they work. One could argue that we’re making it harder on ourselves trying to do both: using phones at home and email at work.</p>

<p>Email, on the other hand, is certainly <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/10/teens-email-use-study_n_1268470.html" target="_blank">on the decline</a>, particularly among younger generations. However, the trend is probably more symptomatic of its shrinking market share rather than its loss of usefulness. Once the king of electronic communications, email is now only a sliver of the new inbox: your phone.</p>

<p>That device in your pocket is your portal to the world. It’s a catchall for the myriad communications you receive — and it’s one of the best communications devices you own because it’s good at filtering content.</p>

<p>Consider the average mobile operating system: It’s designed to funnel a massive and diverse collection of messages and content directly to you. But you can receive and digest that information quickly because of how it’s carved up.</p>

<p>On an average day, you’ll pull out your phone, look for any notifications, and decide on the fly what does or does not require your attention. A direct message is probably worthy of an immediate view, as is a retweet or a tag in Instagram. Your inbox is usually on the list of things to check, but it might not always be the first place you look.</p>

<p>In this way, the phone is the new inbox, but better. Our phones automatically curate and organize communications for us. A brief view can identify what deserves immediate attention and what can wait. Within the world of internal communications, we call this “compartmentalizing.”</p>

<p>The reason mobile devices have had such a critical impact on our lives is partially due to how we are able to manage notifications. An inbox might simply state that you have 500+ emails, which doesn’t provide much information about content, and is really more of a reminder that a chore awaits. Email can be organized into folders, but there is still little to differentiate one message from another based on its content.</p>

<p>With mobile apps, however, you know what kind of information is contained within, which immediately gives you a strong idea of how to interact with the notification and whether you need to engage actively or passively with the content. Apps on our phones have become the new version of email folders, but they provide more layers of formatting and responsive environments to interact with what’s on the screen. App developers are constantly fine tuning their products to improve the experience based on how users interact with the app and its content.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s best to think of the rise and fall of different forms of communication less as a sign that any single form is better, and more as an indication that we are spreading the wealth when it comes to handling our communications.</p>

<p>Communications analyst Jeff Kagan explained a similar thought this way, according to the <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/will-social-media-replace-text-messaging-analysts-speak-out-nations-first-decline-sms-messaging" target="_blank">International Business Times</a>:</p>

<p class="pa-1"><i class="pa-1">“The idea of sending a message is not declining, it’s actually increasing. Individual pieces of the puzzle are shrinking. So it’s just one of the earlier [technologies] that’s shrinking, but the idea of text messaging is actually growing.”</i></p>

<p>In other words, we’re all communicating just as much — if not more — but we have more ways to do so. Email is just a small piece of the pie that contains all of our informal and formal communications.</p>
