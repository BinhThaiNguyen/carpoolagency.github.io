The fact that you’re reading this implies that you are very much on board with the whole social enterprise thing. Chances are, you use Yammer, you work out loud, and you’ve found that it’s a pretty good deal.

<p>On the other end of the social spectrum, however, it’s easy for many people to become set in their ways. We find something that works and we stick with it, so we don’t care when someone comes along and tries to convince us otherwise. It can be hard to persuade these people to adopt a new technology and a new way of working.
Here are many of the arguments you will likely hear against using social tools at work, and some tips to combat them.</p>

### 1. Too Much Noise
<p>There is a ton of information available today. It can become overwhelming, particularly as you get older. Pew Research found that people over 50 years old are more likely to feel overwhelmed by the plethora of online information than are people between ages 18 and 49.</p>
<p>That’s just at home. At work it’s not at all uncommon to feel like we’re spending most of our time managing information rather than completing actual work. Therefore the thought of adding any more information can be unwelcome to some.</p>
<p>But there’s no need to be overwhelmed by extra information when most of it won’t require your attention — unless you’re curious enough to look. What’s most impressive about social tools like Yammer is is their ability to house massive amounts of conversation, work dialogue, and data storage of past projects, yet it can all be consumed passively. In other words, just because it’s there doesn’t mean you have to engage.</p>

### 2. Too Many Tools
<p>Here’s a common scenario most people imagine when you talk to them about a modern workplace: Get to work; open email, open IM, pull up team site, log in to company social network; check each one periodically throughout the day; tear hair from head as needed.</p>
<p>It’s possible for this to become the reality, but only for people who make their work fit the tools rather than allow the tools to manage their workplace communications better. While it was once true that the only office communications you had to worry about came from either a vacuum tube or straight from your boss’ mouth, modern communication is more diversified and nuanced.</p>
<p>In order to get through the day, it’s becoming increasingly necessary to compartmentalize our communications. This doesn’t mean that we must add more communications tools just for the sake of adding more tools. Instead, we must use those tools in advantageous ways. Whether we’re talking about email, IM, or Yammer, it’s best to think of each tool as serving a specific purpose in handling pieces of our varied daily communications.</p>

### 3. Who Cares About Millennials?
<p>It’s easy to hate on millennials. Actually, it can be kind of fun, too. If you’re of a different generation, it’s exceedingly difficult to not pass judgment on the generation that created hipsters, killed paper products, and brought back dead technologies and fashions for the sake of irony.</p>
<p>All that being said, there is value in observing how millennials communicate. This is a generation that didn’t know a time before the Internet. In fact, many of them can’t remember a time before smartphones.</p>
<p>They were raised in a world that is full of information, but they get to choose what information to digest and how. Despite some of their recent bad ideas — specifically the resurgence of the mustache — they’re naturally attuned to create, consume, and share massive amounts of content. This is both a product of the technology they use, as well as the way they use it.</p>
<p>For older generations, let them know that mimicking millennials is more about observing how they communicate, not what they’re talking about.</p>

<div style="font-size: 48px; color: #878787; line-height: 60px; width: 650px; padding: 50px 0 50px 0; height: 300px;"><img src="/carpool/img/quotes_open.png" style="width: 30px; display: block; float: left; margin-right: 20px;"><div style="display: block; width: 600px; float: left; padding-top: 20px;">So it’s not as if he didn’t<br>look at his messages ... he<br>just didn’t open them.<img src="/carpool/img/quotes_close.png" style="width: 30px; margin: 0; display: inline; margin-left: 20px; transform: translateY(15px)"></div></div>

### 4. Too Hard to Change
<p>Sure, change is difficult. It’s the reason that email has survived as the predominant form of workplace communication despite losing ground in all other aspects of our lives. It’s the reason we still compose formal work communications with a greeting and a signature as an anachronism of the early days of pen-and-paper postage.
The fact remains that many people can probably go through their entire careers and remain set in their ways with little impact to their professional lives. I’ve heard it argued that people who refuse to adopt new ways of working will get left behind, become irrelevant, and find themselves gainfully unemployed. But I don’t think that’s accurate.</p>
<p>The more likely outcome for people who refuse to change is that they will be left out. It’s doubtful that many will be fired from their jobs, but entirely reasonable that they will miss critical opportunities to grow.</p>
<p>Between 2012 and 2014, enterprise social network subscribers increased nearly 30%. And if increasingly more conversations are taking place on these networks, those who refuse to adopt social communication platforms will miss opportunities to contribute and show just how valuable they are.</p>

### 5. Email Works Fine Enough
<p>At a recent Carpool workshop we asked for everyone in the room to check the number of unread emails in their inboxes. Can you guess the record?
If you guessed 50,000, you’re way off — it was more than 89,000. According to the record-holder — who explained jokingly, “I’m not proud of this” — he scans the subject line of messages to decide what’s important and what isn’t. So it’s not as if he didn’t look at his messages, he explained, he just didn’t open them.</p>
<p>Managing email has become such a significant part of our day (the average employee spends about one-third of the workday reading and answering emails) that it’s reasonable to think a message doesn’t need to be read just because it was sent to you. There are hefty email chains that don’t require our immediate attention, or company-wide newsletters that aren’t absolutely pressing if you have other tasks waiting.</p>
<p>But what about the messages that do require attention and still get skipped because the subject line seemed insignificant? Not all important information is marked by a snazzy subject line.</p>
<p>This is where a social network like Yammer shines. It’s a tool uniquely positioned to handle communications that require immediate attention, and one that allows for a speedy response. Email, on the other hand, is well suited to house communications that can be dealt with later. The problem becomes when one tool is used improperly and crucial information is either lost or delayed.</p>

### What Do You Think?
There are many challenges we must overcome when pushing social in the workplace. One of the key things to remember is that social tools are not perfect. But when people can learn how to minimize the noise and maximize the use of the tools, soon they won’t be asking which tool to use but how to use the tools together to have the best experience. Education and open mindedness are the tricky part.
