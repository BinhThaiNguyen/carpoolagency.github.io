            Carpool Environment Design
        </div>
        <div class="sectionText mt-3 mb-6">
            We want to help you work better. That means designing an environment, not selling a tool. At Carpool, our goal, first and foremost, is to build you a work environment that facilitates a flow of information and allows your people to work faster, easier, and more accurately. 
            <br><br> 
            It Begins With People
            Who are you? What do your people do? What value do they bring to the team? How do they fit into your overall organization? 
            <br><br>
            Each person is a potential touchpoint for vital information and we want to understand where they fit, what they need to do their jobs more efficiently, and what value they offer to others. Carpool's value mapping process allows us to build an all-up blueprint of your internal communications. This serves as the foundation from which we can help you increase the value of your entire community. Everyone has value; we want to maximize that value and help them share it.
            <br><br> 
            Once we pull together relevant data about your people—who they are, what they do, how they interact, how social they are—we can develop a firm understanding of how information moves throughout your organization. Most importantly, we can begin to see the gaps in that flow.
            <br><br> 
            Technology That Works for You
            If people are the touchpoints for information, then technology is the conduit through which the information flows. Our mission is to ensure that conduit connects the right people in the right way to deliver information as quickly as possible.
            <br><br> 
            This requires an in-depth analysis of your existing communication tools and how people use them. We research the types of tools, whether they are used effectively, additional tools that can further improve the flow of information, and then develop a plan to fit all the technology pieces together into a cohesive communications package.
            <br><br> 
            Every organization sets guidelines, whether consciously or not, that dictate how information is guided by specific tools and, ultimately, how it is created, accessed, shared, and consumed. We uncover those guidelines, look for gaps, and design an environment that removes the hurdles in your information flow.
            <br><br>
            Data-Based Results
            <br><br>
            Carpool will create a technology plan for you. Furthermore, we will establish the infrastructure to measure and track your internal communications. In today's digital world, it's possible to track just about anything. We make informed decisions with measurable outcomes, founded on a baseline with key indicator tracking. We can see how people use the communications tools available to them and determine how best to help your people use technology to do work better.
            <br><br> 
            Content is King
            <br><br>
            Content is more than just a buzzword—it is the difference between bulk data and meaningful information that can have positive impacts on the way people work.
            <br><br> 
            Carpool will analyze where your content originates and how it flows. Is your internal communications content derived from external sources or internal? Which members of your team generate content? Which executives generate content? And, most importantly, who is consuming that content and how?
            <br><br> 
            When we understand your company's content consumption patterns, we can understand how people utilize data and how to package it in the most effective way. Carpool helps teams understand the benefits of strong content management. We create a strategy for you to highlight the most important and valuable information that is based on your company mission, vision, and priorities.

            Carpool Implementation Strategy
        </div>
        <div class="sectionText mt-3 mb-6">
            At Carpool, when we say "implementation," we mean much more than just building tools and designing vibrant internal communications environments—we get people excited about their new communications environment and develop communities of people that want to work in a new way.
            <br><br>
            It’s a Whole New World
            <br><br>
            Your people can only work better when they understand how a new way of working can help them highlight their value to the community and find new ways to do their jobs faster, easier, and with greater reach. Carpool strives to find solutions that fit within your unique business. Then we get to work engaging your workforce and helping them excel.
             <br><br>
            Carpool works with individuals or small teams and empowers them to become leaders who inspire evolutionary communications models throughout the company. We build tools for individuals and teams and provide training so they can become champions for the new communications principles and technology for the organization.
             <br><br>
            Why do we work this way? Because experience has taught us that, in order to be successful in effecting positive change, a company's culture must be nurtured from the small scale up through the large scale. Carpool restructures internal communications at the DNA level, sparking evolutions that grow throughout your company culture not because something was mandated, but because people begin to see how they can work better.
            <br><br> 
            Implementation carries out in two phases: engage and build.
            <br><br> 
            Engage
            Carpool's team of internal communications strategists and account managers get the word out on your new internal communications strategy and highlight new communications tools. We have a proven track record of getting people excited about working in a better way. We do this through trainings, workshops, hands-on support, and creative marketing campaigns.
            <br><br>
            Build
            After the analysis and environment design [LINK TO ENVIRONMENT DESIGN PAGE] we start building the tools and implementing strategies that fill any gaps in your internal communications and get information flowing better. Carpool maintains a team of clever and inventive developers who can find innovative solutions to help you evolve the way you work through our suite of flexible technology options.
            <br><br>
            Emergent Information Flow
            It takes a well-thought-out mixture of engagement strategy and technology infrastructure to improve the flow of communication. Carpool helps you achieve the right blend of both to create a thriving environment that fosters healthy workplace conversation, content creation, and formal consumption.
